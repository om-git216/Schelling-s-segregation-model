# Schelling-s-segregation-model

**Schelling's segregation model**  

This model is used to understand why people with different ethnic backgrounds segregate geographically. The assumptions of the model are as follows:  
1. Two different types of agents are distributed in a finttie 2D space
2. In each iteration, a randomly chosen agent looks around its neighbourhood, and if the fraction of agents of the same type among its neighbours is below a threshold, it jumps to another location randomly chosen in space.

The results of the simulation are as follows:
